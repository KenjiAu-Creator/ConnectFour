The project is to create a command line version of the game Connect four. This project will be TDD-style so RSpec tests will be written before the code implementation. 

The game has a six row, seven column board where the aim is to have form the first horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available sapace within the column.
